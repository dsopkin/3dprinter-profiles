### Adhesion
Adhesion is tricky, but the raft works well. Also have tried "initial fan speed" at 0 and regular fan speed at 4, that seems to work although like other times the model seems to stick too well to the raft.

### Quality
Near-perfect, however overhanging ledges are not perfectly smooth.

### Settings

### Other Notes
Have tried enabling the "coasting" setting, because I was anticipating stringing with certain models when they were printed. What ended up happening was it provided a 'zit' for each new layer change. Keeping retraction on and coasting off is the best bet here.
