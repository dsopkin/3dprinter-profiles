## Notes
Awesome filament once you get the temperature tuned correctly. Printed at 0.2mm and 0.12mm layer heights on Creality glass bed (non-stick side) with masking tape, and have gotten excellent results (with a bit of stringing and random pieces). Overall I feel like I have nailed the tuning on this filament and can print high quality stuff with it.

80C (bed)

Good adhesion qualities on masking tape.
